# The Task
Create an Android application that will fetch information about the current Bitcoin market price from
an API (suggested resources will be provided below, however you may decide to use other resources) and
display the data in a graph of your choice.

## Must-haves:
* Good project structure - well structured packages, files and resources
* Attention to detail - tidy code that is easy to read, consistent formatting, meaningful naming conventions,
no IDE warnings
* Architecture design that promotes separation of concerns
* Use of Kotlin
* Unit tests
* Use of Material Design principles and efficient layout design
* Use of RxJava2
* Dependency injection (Dagger is preferred)

## Good-to-haves:
* Multi-modular project structure
* Use of Clean Architecture + MVVM or MVP or similar
* Espresso tests
* Gracefully handled loading/error states

## Suggested Resources:
Here is a list of resources that you can use for your code challenge. By no means are these mandatory
to include or use, so feel free to use other resources/architectural styles of your choice.
